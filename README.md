This repository provides the R code that accompanies the article "Towards the integration of animal-borne instruments into global ocean observing systems"


### Requirements
* R-studio with R >= 3.1.0
* Packages:

## Installation

The R code can be downloaded from the following [link](https://github.com/dmarch/abigoos/archive/master.zip). Additionaly, check out this guideline at the [Rstudio website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) for installing Git on your computer and creating a new project.


## Getting started

There several steps that need to be conducted before running the scripts. 

* Download raw data from third-party providers (see bellow)
* Edit the paths to those datasets


## Workflow

* Prepare the study area
* Process and analyse Argo float data
* Generate a species database
* Process and prepare distribution ranges
* Process and preapre tracking data
* Overlap analysis


## Structure of the repository
* data_paths.R: Script to set your data paths, temp and output folders
* /argo: folder with scripts to process Argo data (density, undersampled, hotspot, eez, gradients)
* /tel: folder with scripts to process animal telemetry data
* /eoo: folder with scripts to process extents of occurrence of species
* /overlap: folder with scripts to overlap under-sampled regions with species distributions
* /overlap/ov_eoo.R
* /overlap/ov_tel.R
* /overlap/compare_eoo_tel.R
* /ocean: folder with script to process the ocean and landmask
* /common: utils.R, oceanmask.R, zonal.R
* /plots: R scripts for generating the figures
* /output: output files. (figures and nc)


## Datasets

### Raw data

Most of the data used is open and freely available. However, some datasets (e.g. Birdlife, SWOT and OBIS-SEAMAP) will require a data request or form registration with the data providers.

* Bathymetry
* Argo profiles from GDAC
* MEOP-CTD database
* OBIS-SEAMAP
* IUCN spatial data
* Birdlife
* SWOT
* SeaVox Salt and Fresh Water Body Gazetter (v16 2015)
* Land mask, Natural Earth


### Data products

Data products generated by the R code can be accessed in DOI:

* Ocean mask
* List of animal-borne platform species (with results from analysis). 
* Argo gaps (unsampled and undersampled) per year. (1nc)
* EOO maps per species (1nc) => not sure if could be redistributed...
* Telemetry maps per species (1nc) => not sure if could be redistributed...
* Overlap maps with EOO per species (1nc)
* Overlap maps with telemetry per species (1nc)
