This repository provides the R code that accompanies the article "Towards the integration of animal-borne instruments into global ocean observing systems"


### Requirements
* R-studio with R >= 3.1.0
* Packages:

## Installation

The R code can be downloaded from the following [link](https://github.com/dmarch/abigoos/archive/master.zip). Additionaly, check out this guideline at the [Rstudio website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) for installing Git on your computer and creating a new project.


## Getting started

There several steps that need to be conducted before running the scripts. 

* Download raw data from third-party providers (see bellow)
* Edit the paths to those datasets


## Workflow

* Prepare the study area
* Process and analyse Argo float data
* Generate a species database
* Process and prepare distribution ranges
* Process and preapre tracking data
* Overlap analysis


## Structure of the repository
* data_paths.R: Script to set your data paths, temp and output folders
* /argo: folder with scripts to process Argo data (density, undersampled, hotspot, eez, gradients)
* /tel: folder with scripts to process animal telemetry data
* /eoo: folder with scripts to process extents of occurrence of species
* /overlap: folder with scripts to overlap under-sampled regions with species distributions
* /overlap/ov_eoo.R
* /overlap/ov_tel.R
* /overlap/compare_eoo_tel.R
* /ocean: folder with script to process the ocean and landmask
* /common: utils.R, oceanmask.R, zonal.R
* /plots: R scripts for generating the figures
* /output: output files. (figures and nc)


## Datasets

### Raw data

Most of the data used is open and freely available. However, some datasets (e.g. Birdlife, SWOT and OBIS-SEAMAP) will require a data request or form registration with the data providers.

## Use of external services

This project uses an external service [IUCN](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/) that requires the generation of a token. It also uses the API from FishBase and SeaLifeBase.
